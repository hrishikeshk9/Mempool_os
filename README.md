# Mempool_os
This is basic assignment wherein you already have a memory pool and you are asked to allocate some part of that to Threads as per requirement.
'memory splitting' is used (referred many experts codes for this!). 

**Basic purpose is to mimic the OS (is some sense :P) and understand more.


Prerequisites :

gcc (c compiler)



Compiling and execution :

gcc mempool.c -o mempool -lpthread

./mempool
